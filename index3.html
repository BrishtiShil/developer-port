            <h2>Introduction :</h2>
            <p class="gray-color">A portfolio is a collection of financial investments like stocks, bonds, commodities,
                cash, and cash
                equivalents,
                including closed-end funds and exchange traded funds (ETFs). People generally believe that stocks,
                bonds,
                and
                cash comprise the core of a portfolio. Though this is often the case, it does not need to be the rule. A
                portfolio may contain a wide range of assets including real estate, art, and private investments.


                You may choose to hold and manage your portfolio yourself, or you may allow a money manager, financial
                advisor,
                or another finance professional to manage your portfolio.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion :</h2>
            <p class="gray-color">The best way to build a sound investment portfolio is by determining its financial
                objective and
                rebalancing its components frequently. Subsequently, investors should focus more on diversifying their
                resources to attain the best possible rewards at manageable risks in all situations. In case individuals
                lack the farsightedness or market knowledge to manage a portfolio, they should seek a professional
                opinion.Typically, investors who are nearing their retirement are recommended to invest a more
                significant portion of their portfolio in less risky assets like â€“ cash and bonds and the remainder in
                higher-yielding options. On the other hand, those who have just begun their career are suggested to
                invest the larger portion of their portfolio into high risk-reward investment options for the long haul.
                A longer time frame will help them to ride out the short-term market fluctuations and losses.
